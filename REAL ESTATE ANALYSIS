Real Estate Property Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of a real estate dataset. The dataset includes various attributes related to real estate properties, such as location, price, number of bedrooms, square footage, and more. The analysis explores the relationships between different property features and their impact on property prices.

Dataset Overview
The dataset provides detailed information on real estate properties, including:

Property location
Price
Number of bedrooms
Square footage (living space and lot)
Number of floors
Waterfront status
View
Condition and grade
Year built and renovated
Zip code, latitude, and longitude
Data Loading
To load the dataset, ensure you have pandas installed. Use the following code to load the dataset:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_excel("/path/to/Housing_dataset.xlsx")
Initial Data Exploration
Shape of Dataset
The dataset contains 21,613 rows and 20 columns.

Number of Cells
The total number of cells in the dataset is 432,260.

Data Information
The dataset does not have any missing values and consists of different data types, including integers, floats, and objects.

Data Visualization and Analysis
Price Distribution
A histogram was created to visualize the distribution of property prices.

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.hist(df["price"], bins=20, color=["salmon"], edgecolor="black")
plt.xlabel("Property Price")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.title("Distribution of Property Prices")
plt.show()
Bedrooms vs. Property Prices
The average price was calculated for different numbers of bedrooms and visualized using a bar plot.

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

bedroom_avg_price = df.groupby("bedrooms")["price"].mean()

plt.bar(bedroom_avg_price.index, bedroom_avg_price.values, color=["skyblue", "salmon", "lightgreen"])
plt.xlabel("Number of Bedrooms")
plt.ylabel("Average Price")
plt.title("Average Price by Number of Bedrooms")
plt.show()
Waterfront View Impact
The average price for waterfront vs. non-waterfront properties was compared using a bar plot.

python
Copy code
waterfront_avg_price = df.groupby("waterfront")["price"].mean()

plt.bar(waterfront_avg_price.index, waterfront_avg_price.values, color=["skyblue", "salmon"])
plt.xlabel("Waterfront (0: No, 1: Yes)")
plt.ylabel("Average Price")
plt.title("Average Price: Waterfront vs. Non-Waterfront")
plt.xticks([0, 1], ["Non-Waterfront", "Waterfront"])
plt.show()
Average Price by Year Built
A line plot was created to show how average property prices vary with the year of construction.

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Year_avg_price = df.groupby(["yr_built"])["price"].mean()

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(Year_avg_price.index, Year_avg_price.values, marker='o', color='salmon', label='Average Price')
plt.xlabel('Year Built')
plt.ylabel('Average Price')
plt.title('Average Property Price by Year of Construction')
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
Price by Property Location
The mean price by year built was analyzed for different property locations using line graphs.

python
Copy code
grouped_data = df.groupby(['Property location', 'yr_built'])['price'].mean().reset_index()

unique_locations = grouped_data['Property location'].unique()
for location in unique_locations:
    location_data = grouped_data[grouped_data['Property location'] == location]
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 3))
    plt.plot(location_data['yr_built'], location_data['price'], marker='o', color='lightgreen', label=location)
    plt.xlabel('Year Built')
    plt.ylabel('Mean Price')
    plt.title(f'Mean Price by Year Built for {location}')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
Price Difference with/without Basement
The impact of having a basement on property price was analyzed.

python
Copy code
basement_prices = df.groupby(df['sqft_basement'] > 0)['price'].mean()

print(basement_prices)
Correlation Analysis
Price vs. Square Footage
A joint plot was created to explore the relationship between square footage of living space and property price.

python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns

sns.jointplot(x="sqft_living", y="price", data=df, kind='reg', color='salmon')
plt.show()
Spearman Correlations
Spearman correlations were calculated for various features with price:

python
Copy code
from scipy import stats

r, p = stats.spearmanr(df['bedrooms'], df['price'])
print(f'Spearman correlation r between price and bedrooms is {r} with p = {p}')

r, p = stats.spearmanr(df['floors'], df['price'])
print(f'Spearman correlation r between price and floors is {r} with p = {p}')

r, p = stats.spearmanr(df['view'], df['price'])
print(f'Spearman correlation r between price and view is {r} with p = {p}')

r, p = stats.spearmanr(df['grade'], df['price'])
print(f'Spearman correlation r between price and grade is {r} with p = {p}')
Conclusion
Property prices generally increase with the number of bedrooms and waterfront status.
Average property prices have shown varying trends over different years, with peaks in certain years.
Properties with basements tend to have higher prices compared to those without.
Correlation analysis indicates strong positive relationships between property prices and features like square footage and grade.
